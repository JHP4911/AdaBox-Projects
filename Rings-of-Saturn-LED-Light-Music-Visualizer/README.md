# Rings-of-Saturn-LED-Light-Music-Visualizer
This is the code that is used for my "Rings of Saturn" light.  It is very crude code right now, and there are a couple bugs, but it works for the most part.  I used an electret microphone input, and a 6-channel RF receiver with remote, connected to an Arduino Mega.  I plan to port this to an ESP8266 for Wifi control at some point.

The video of the light I made with this code is here: https://youtu.be/g7A8h72RwdY
