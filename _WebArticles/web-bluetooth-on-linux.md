# Web Bluetooth on Linux

First, you should type `bluetoothd --version` in the terminal, and see which version of Bluez you have - then follow the correct set of instructions below:

Bluetooth _may_ work out of the box - try following the [Web Bluetooth getting started code](/Puck.js Quick Start) and see if it works.

However, on Bluez 5.41 you still need to enable the Experimental flags. Edit the Bluetooth config and add the experimental flag there:
    
    
    sudo nano /lib/systemd/system/bluetooth.service

And update the line:
    
    
    ExecStart=/usr/lib/bluetooth/bluetoothd

so it reads:
    
    
    ExecStart=/usr/lib/bluetooth/bluetoothd --experimental

Save and exit. Then reload Bluez.
    
    
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    sudo systemctl restart bluetooth

## Bluez < 5.41: Ubuntu 16.04, Mint 18 and older

**Note:** Alan Assis worked this out and documented it [here](https://acassis.wordpress.com/2016/06/28/how-to-get-chrome-web-bluetooth-working-on-linux/). All I've done is tweak it slightly to use a newer bluez (and to modify things that didn't work for me)

**Note 2:** Ubuntu 16.10 comes with `bluez` 5.41 already, but the experimental interface flag is needed for this version. This means you'll have to build it again with the appropriate flag.

As of writing, Ubuntu 16.04 comes with version 5.37 of `bluez`, the Bluetooth tools. While this provides some Bluetooth functionality, it's not very good at exposing it. As a result, for Web Bluetooth on Chrome to work, you need to update your `bluez` version to a newer version, which exposes functionality in a way that Chrome can access without needing special permissions.
    
    
    # Install the dependecies:
    sudo apt-get -y install automake autotools-dev bison check clang flex lcov libcap-ng-dev libdbus-glib-1-dev libdw-dev libglib2.0-dev libical-dev libreadline-dev libtool libudev-dev
    
    # create temp directory
    mkdir tmp
    cd tmp
    
    # Download new bluez
    wget http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/bluetooth/bluez-5.45.tar.xz# Extract it:
    tar xvf bluez-5.45.tar.xz
    
    # Configure and compile it:
    cd bluez-5.45./configure --prefix=/usr           \
                --mandir=/usr/share/man \
                --sysconfdir=/etc       \
                --localstatedir=/var    \
                --enable-library        \
                --disable-systemd       \
                --disable-android       
    make
    
    # install everything
    sudo make install
    
    # Stop existing bluetooth and start a new one
    sudo /etc/init.d/bluetooth stop
    sudo /usr/libexec/bluetooth/bluetoothd

Now you can test Web Bluetooth out in Chrome (make sure you enable it in chrome://flags first!). Maybe give the Web IDE a go: <https://www.espruino.com/ide>

If that all works, we want to make sure it runs properly after a reboot.

Ctrl-C to stop the existing bluetoothd.
    
    
    # Replace the old bluetoothd with the new one:
    sudo cp /usr/libexec/bluetooth/bluetoothd /usr/lib/bluetooth/bluetoothd

Now you can re-start the service and you're good to go!
    
    
    sudo /etc/init.d/bluetooth start
