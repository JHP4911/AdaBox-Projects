## Resistors in Series

When [resistors](https://www.kitronik.co.uk/components/resistors.html) are connected one after each other this is called connecting in series. This is shown below.

To calculate the total overall resistance of a number of resistors connected in this way you add up the individual resistances. This is done using the following formula:

_Rtotal = R1 + R2 +R3_ and so on.

Example: To calculate the total resistance for these three resistors in series.

> _Resistors in Parallel_

When resistors are connected across each other (side by side) this is called connecting in parallel. This is shown below.

> _Two Resistors in Parallel_

To calculate the total overall resistance of a of two resistors connected in this way you can use the following formula:

Example: To calculate the total resistance for these two resistors in parallel.
