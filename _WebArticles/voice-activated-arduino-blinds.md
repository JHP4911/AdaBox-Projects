A while ago I made an Instructable where I added a servo and Bluetooth device to my door lock letting me control it with my phone like an addict I just can't stop adding Bluetooth to stuff and so in this project I'm going to show you how to make Bluetooth controlled blinds with some voice activation features. Let's get started!

## Step 1: Parts List

This project is pretty cheap and really doesn't need that many parts, the parts we will need are:

And for tools and materials we will need:

  * Cardboard 
  * Wire 
  * soldering iron and solder 
  * hot glue gun and hot glue 
  * Box cutter

## Step 2: Features 

So the main feature that these blinds are going have is the ability to open and close them from an app. I have two blinds that I want to control with this device so I'm going to be using two motors, one for each blind. When the command U is sent through the Bluetooth device it will spin both motors to the open position and if the command D is sent both motors will spin to the closed position. Now one of the issues I had with my Bluetooth door lock project was that my phone would die before I got home meaning I wouldn't be able to get into my room and so for this project we are going to be adding buttons to the device that let us open the blinds when the button is pressed. Now, of course, this will also feature voice control and the ability to control individual motors allowing us to open one blind at a time but ill talk more about that later,
