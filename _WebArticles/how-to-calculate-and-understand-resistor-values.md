## Resistors

A [resistor](https://www.kitronik.co.uk/components/resistors.html) is a device that opposes the flow of electrical current. The bigger the value of a resistor the more it opposes the current flow. The value of a resistor is given in ohms and is often referred to as its 'resistance'.

### Identifying Resistor Values

Example: Band 1 = Red, Band 2 = Violet, Band 3 = Orange, Band 4 = Gold
Too many zeros?

The value of this resistor would be:
kilo ohms and mega

2 (Red) 7 (Violet) x1,000 (Orange)
= 27 x 1,000
ohms can be used:

= 27,000 with a 5% tolerance (gold)
1,000 ohms =1k

= 27k ohms
1,000k = 1M

### Calculating Resistor Markings

Calculate what the colour bands would be for the following resistor values.

**Value**
**1st Band**
**2nd Band**
**Multiplier x **

180 ohms

3,900 ohms

47,000 ohms (47k)

1,000,000 ohms(1M)

### What does Tolerance mean?

Resistors always have a tolerance but what does this mean? It refers to the accuracy to which it has been manufactured. For example if you were to measure the resistance of a gold tolerance resistor you can guarantee that the value measured will be within 5% of its stated value. Tolerances are important if the accuracy of a resistors value is critical to a designs performance.

### Preferred Values

There are a number of different ranges of values for resistors. Two of the most popular are the E12 and E24. They take into account the manufacturing tolerance and are chosen such that there is a minimum overlap between the upper possible value of the first value in the series and the lowest possible value of the next. Hence there are fewer values in the 10% tolerance range.
