Paper planes are fun to make. If you were bored in class, you would make them and throw it across the room, hoping that the teacher does not catch you (or the plane). But paper planes were fun while they lasted...in the air. Today, I will walk you through step-by-step on how to make a full, radio-controlled paper plane. I've always wanted a RC plane, but the good radio-controlled ones are fairly expensive and the ones you get under 20 dollars are controlled by infrared light, which means that you cannot take it outside, or else you will lose control of it, due to the sun's rays which also emits infrared light (trust me, I've lost control of too many of those already). Along the way, I will also teach you the fundamentals of electronics and let your first project lift you off to new heights. So let's get started!

## Step 1: How Will the Finished Project Work?

In this instructable, I will show you how to make a RC paper plane with a complementary joystick controller. Before you turn on the plane, hold the joystick in the 'off' position, which means move the joystick all the way down and while doing that, turn on the plane. When you release the joystick, it will automatically go back to the center position, which is middle throttle, and all the way up, full throttle. If you are ready to throw your plane, put the joystick to full throttle and throw the plane. Steer left or right by moving the joystick left and right while holding your desired throttle (so that means if you are flying at full throttle, don't release the joystick, having it fall back to middle throttle and turn then, simply steer left or right while holding the throttle up). To land, simply pull the throttle to off and the plane will glide to a landing. This plane is also built to have a low battery warning. When you notice that the plane does not respond, it means that you either have fine out of range or the battery is low.

Note: when the battery is low, the motors will automatically cut out to make sure that the battery does not get damaged.
