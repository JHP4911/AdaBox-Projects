I have some rust on my driveway and some old rusty tools I got from my grandfather years ago.

I have been looking at sand and soda blasters for about 6 months. They are either inexpensive and cheap or very well made and expensive!

So I decided lets just make one.

## Step 1: Get Crap

Go get some crap at Harbor Freight. This air gun kit ran $4.99.

Now find a bottle in the trash.

## Step 2: Say "Hi" to the Cat

This optional but important step may be the difference between you succeeding or failing.

## Step 3: Cut the Neck

## Step 4: Drill

## Step 5: Test Fit

Push the air rod in. It should be very snug!

## Step 6: Mark

Mark the bottom of the air tube. Spin the tube around so you can hold the handle while you file.

## Step 7: File

File a hole through the tube to let your media in. When you're done spin the tube back so the opening is at the bottom.

## Step 8: Fit

## Step 9: Seal

Not looking for the glue to actually stick here.

Just looking to prevent the hole from opening up too much while under pressure.

## Step 10: Test Blast

Put your Saftey goggles and gloves on and give it a good blast. I shot at the rust on the drive way and removed a spot (the white part) in just a few seconds.

I will give you an update on the driveway once I have time to do some actual blasting on it.

## Step 13: Extra Step

Because everyone keeps asking this is my air compressor a California Air Tools 10020c running at about 40 PSI for blasting.

I also use 20/40 crushed walnut for my media.

For PPE I use gloves, a P-100 respirator, long sleeves and a face shield. No excuses! Do not compromise safety!

Video coming soon! Check back in the next few days.
