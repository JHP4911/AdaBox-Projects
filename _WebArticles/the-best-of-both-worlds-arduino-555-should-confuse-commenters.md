# The Best of Both Worlds: Arduino + 555 Should Confuse Commenters

Hardly a week goes by that some Hackaday post doesn't elicit one of the following comments:

> That's stupid! Why use an Arduino when you could do the same thing with a 555?

And:

> That's stupid! Why use a bunch of parts when you can use an Arduino?

However, we rarely see those two comments on the same post. Until now. [ZHut] managed to bring these two worlds together by presenting how to make [an Arduino blink an LED in conjunction with a 555 timer](https://zhutarduino.wordpress.com/arduino-projects/arduino-how-to-blink-a-led-without-using-delays-in-your-sketch/). We know, we know. It is hard to decide how to comment about this. You can consider it while you watch the video, below.

On the plus side, there probably is a use case for this. The LED will blink with absolutely no intervention from the Arduino. You could put the Arduino in deep sleep, if you wanted to and that LED will still blink. With a little work, you could probably adapt this idea to any number of circuits out of the 555 playbook, like a [PWM generator](https://hackaday.com/2013/09/15/the-easy-or-hard-way-to-build-a-pwm-dimmer/), for example.

There's almost nothing a 555 can't do. If you want to see what's under its expressionless face, this [teardown](https://hackaday.com/2016/02/23/555-teardown-and-analysis/) is an interesting read. We just hope the comment section doesn't overload like a Star Trek computer being asked by Captain Kirk to compute every digit of pi.
