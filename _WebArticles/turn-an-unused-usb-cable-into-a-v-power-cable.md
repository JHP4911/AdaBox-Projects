Rimstar has another DIY how-to guide, this time for turning a USB cable (especially those male Type-B cables that you might have an abundance of) into a [simple 5V power cable](https://rimstar.org/science_electronics_projects/make_usb_power_cable.htm). The video includes showing how to conduct a simple continuity test that's a great example of learning how the wires inside a cable relate to the pins inside the plug (this how-to knowledge can be broadly applied to many cable types).

And if that excites you you might also be interested in the USB-A male and female blocks recently added to the store:
