In this activity, you will make a map to highlight points of interest using button flaps when explanations are revealed.

**Grades**: 1 to 12+**|****Duration**: Up To 1 Hour

**Supplies**: multiple LEDs, Map, 2 sheets of White Paper

### Step #1

For this project, we will need a map to tell our story. There are many ways that we can create a map. If we are telling a story based in real world locations, we can easily create a map that is printable in [Google Maps](http://maps.google.com/).

  1. Sign-in to Google.
  2. Click the button in the upper left.
  3. Click Your Places, then Maps, then Create Map.

You can now place pins at points of interest or specific locations. For our version of the project, we will be using a map of Boston and landmarks from around the time of the founding of our country.

If you are tasked with creating a map from a story that has fictional places, you can draw your map before creating the rest of this project.

When you interact with your story, you will press down on captions along the bottom of the map, and a corresponding place will light up! You will need three paper craft parts to construct the project:

  1. Begin by printing out the map you created. Trim its size to about 11 x 6 inches.
  2. You will also need a plain white 8.5 x 11 inch piece of paper.
  3. Finally, you will need a second sheet of paper for the button flaps. It can be a whole sheet, or a single sheet cut in half lengthwise.

The picture above shows how the dimensions line up. Now you're ready to start drawing the circuit!

### Using the Circuit Scribe Simulator

We've been using the [Circuit Scribe Circuit simulator](https://circuits.io/circuitscribe/) to create a rough draft of our map. You can do the same, or design your circuit directly on paper using the Circuit Scribe pen.

If you've never used the simulator before, check out the video in this step.

Let's start designing the circuit. Every point of interest needs an LED to light it up!

  1. Place a piece of white paper over the map so the top edges are touching. Adjust your desk lamp so you can see the map faintly through the paper!
  2. Take the Circuit Stencil and make sure the point of interest is in the center of the two pad template. Fill in the two pads around each point of interest.

We used the Circuit Simulator, below, to show you where our LEDs are arranged. Yours will look similar to this!

Now you'll start creating the buttons for each landmark.

In the empty space below the map, create a two pad template parallel to the long side of the page for each point of interest. Try to space them evenly across the long side of the paper so there is plenty of room to add information about each landmark.

An example of our switch layout is shown in the Simulator, below!

Your light-up map will need some power! Use the circuit stencil to add two pads parallel to the short edge for the battery module.

Tip: add the battery as far up the page as possible so it's hidden underneath the map.

In our simulated circuit, below, the battery will go on the vertical pads on the right edge of the page.

Now we'll start creating connections within the circuit. Keep in mind that each LED needs to be powered by the battery, but operated by its own switch. Let's start by connecting all of the LEDs to the battery.

  1. Draw a continuous line connecting one pad from each LED. In our example (below), we chose the right-hand or top pad from each LED.
  2. Continue the connection from the 5th LED to the top pad of the battery.

Our example is shown in the simulator below.

In this step, you will create the connections between the buttons and the battery.

  1. Draw a continuous connection between the right-hand pads of each button pair. 
  2. Continue the last connection to the bottom terminal of the battery.

Our example is shown in the simulator below.

Finally, each LED needs to be connected to its own switch.

**Draw lines connecting the empty pad of each LED with the empty pad of its corresponding switch.**

In our example, these connections are the 5 vertical lines across the page.

In the next step you will add paper-based switches to your project. First, you can use our simulation to see how each LED is individually operated by its own switch.

Tip: To try the circuit, click "Start Simulation" and click each switch to turn an LED on or off.

In this step you will create the storyline buttons across the bottom of your project.

  1. Place the second sheet of white paper behind the first and slide it down until it looks like there is plenty of room for your captions.
  2. Now, fold the paper up over the bottom edge so it covers the row of pads.
  3. Cut the paper in between each set of two pads to create equal sized rectangles across the page -- one for each landmark.
  4. Finally, draw a patch of silver ink on the bottom side of the flap. This patch will complete the circuit when you flip it up and press down.

Our example shows one of these buttons sticking up with our caption already on it, and two adjacent flaps with silver ink exposed.
