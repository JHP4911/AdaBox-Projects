How to make a free energy generator at home without battery is an ambitious project wich will have more that one part currently i am waiting for parts to improuve this free energy generator in the video at the end of this tutorial you will see measurements output and all you will need to build this free energy device.Warning the output at this moment is 0.7w but it can be improuved to the point that you will able to charge your phone and in the part3 you will able to run light charge a battery and charge your phone and run a radio so you will be set for any emergency power out storme or when the main will fail.

## Step 1: Thermoelectric Generator

The thermoelectric effect is the direct conversion of temperature differences to electric voltage  
and vice versa. A thermoelectric device creates voltage when there is a different temperature on each side. Conversely, when a voltage is applied to it, it creates a temperature difference. At the atomic scale, an applied temperature gradient causes charge carriers in the material to diffuse from the hot side to the cold side.

This effect can be used to generate electricity, measure temperature or change the temperature of objects. Because the direction of heating and cooling is determined by the polarity of the applied voltage, thermoelectric devices can be used as temperature controllers.

## Step 2: Parts Needed for This Free Energy Generator

Parts needed

Aluminium radiators

Peltier module (12706)

Candles 1£/20pieces

Metalic pen holder

0.9vDC-dc boost converter

Thermal compound

All this stuff you will find in an amazon kit

[http://amzn.to/2izGZVf ](http://amzn.to/2izGZVf) and the stuff that is not in the kit you can find them on amazon,ebay or other ecomerce site i will post the links to see wich products i used and you can decide where you will buy them.

The rest is very simple just assemble the radiator with the 2 srews and put the peltier module between them with the thermal compound on bouth sides.

## Step 3: The Free Energy Generator Is Almost Done

The metalic pen holder is used for suspending the radiators and providing some heat disipation to protect the wires for over heating.To run this generator we will use tea candle wich are normally 1£/20pieces so the cost of one candle is arround 0.05£ and this generator can run aprox 4h depending on the quality of the candle.

At this moment the output is 1.5v/0.4A after adjusting the distance from the flame to the small radiator.

And because it a small free energy generator we will need a dc=dc boost converter to step up the voltage

but more improuvements on the part2 till then enjoy the video and post comments to make it better...

## Step 4: Free Energy Generator

The Seebeck effect is the conversion of heat directly into electricity at the junction of different types of wire. It is named after the Baltic German physicist Thomas Johann Seebeck,  
who in 1821 discovered that a compass needle would be deflected by a closed loop formed by two different metals joined in two places, with a temperature difference between the joints.

To connect the peltier module you have to connected first to a 12v battery and observe wich side is getting cold and hot,after this we will apply heat to the hot side and the big aluminium radiator to the cold side,we can place a fan on the cold side to improuve the output.
