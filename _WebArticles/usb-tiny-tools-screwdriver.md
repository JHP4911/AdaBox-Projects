I found many old USB battery pack when I tidy up my room. It mostly come from gift and souvenir. Their capacity often very low, and mostly only can output 500 mA, It is hard to treat it as a backup battery for the current mobile. But I think the old USB battery still can power a bunch of tools.

The first tool I would like to make is a tiny screw driver. When I repairing my gadgets, I need to screw in and out tens of screws, but I don't want the high torque of a normal electric screwdrivers hurt the tiny screws. So I want to make a tiny screwdriver to help me the screwing work.

## Step 2: Prepration
