There are many types of sensors available that enable you to interact with electronics, and so it can be difficult to decide which one is best to use for a project. Furthermore, many tutorials show how to use a single sensor with an Arduino, but it can be unclear how to use lots of them in a project that requires lots of detectors (e.g. laser harps, interactive LED tables, etc.). In this instructable, I will review some sensors (listed below) and focus on how to use them with an Arduino. In addition to the review, I will provide some pros and cons for using each one of these sensor types in Arduino projects that require lots of sensors and explain what to do when there are more sensors than there are pins on the Arduino. Hopefully, this instructable will help you pick the best sensor for your project and understand how to wire many of them up so that they can be used with an Arduino.

**List of detectors in this review:**

Push buttons

IR sensors (Active and passive)

Photodetectors (Photoresistors and phototransistors and photodiodes)

Ultrasonic sensors

Capacitive touch sensing

## Step 1: Push Buttons and Switches

The easiest way to provide someone a way to interact with an electronic device is by using a pushbutton or switch. A switch usually clicks into a position so that a person can click it back and forth, while a pushbutton goes down when pressed and springs back up. The idea is to create a circuit with a pushbutton or switch connected to a resistor, and readout the voltage at the node between the resistor and 5V. The resistor is required so that the circuit is not shorted when the button is pressed.

If the switch or button is not closed, then the readout above the resistor will be zero volts, which is also written as LOW or simply 0. If the switch or button or pressed, the circuit is completed and current will flow, which results in a 5 volt readout above the resistor, which is also written as HIGH or simply 1. Therefore, the switch or pushpin is said to be a digital read, meaning it can be only one of two values.

For an electronics project that requires a lot of two state inputs, switches and pushpins can be a great solution. It is easy to tell when the switch is on or off, and the signals between different switches don't interact (i.e. there is no cross-talk). It is also relatively easy to build your own pushbuttons with conductive material if you want to customize them to a device that you are making or don't want cheap pushbuttons to be visible. See links below for custom switches people have made. You can read in as many switches you have digital pins on the Arduino by putting the switches in parallel (see diagram). Attached is code for reading switches with an Arduino. If you need more inputs, then you can multiplex (see the step 6).

Pros: Clear signal. Reliable. No crosstalk between detectors. Simple to wire. Cheap. Relatively easy to make a custom switch or pushpin.

Cons: Don't detect motion, person must physically touch sensor. Digital readout only.

## Step 2: Infrared Sensors

Infrared (IR) radiation is a form of light with longer waves that is typically not visible to the human eye. IR radiation has the energy of vibrational transitions in molecules, so it is often associated with heat generated by living organisms (imagine IR cameras). In other words, the warmer an object the more IR radiation is emitted from the object.

An IR sensor detects IR radiation in one of two ways. A passive IR sensor consists of only an IR detector. Therefore, it detects the IR radiation emitted from objects, and is useful for detecting the difference between objects of different temperature, like a human entering someone's yard. An active IR sensor consists of both an IR emitter and an IR detector. The emitted IR radiation of an active IR sensor is reflected off of any object and then detected by the IR detector on the sensor. Therefore, active IR sensors are good at detecting an object that passes by the sensor, and usually have better signal quality in comparison to passive IR sensors.

For using lots of IR sensors in a single electronic device, it makes more sense to use an active IR sensor because passive IR sensors have a very large detection range and have much worse signal. This makes it difficult to decipher much of a difference from different passive IR sensors close to each other.

It is possible to assemble your own active IR sensor with an Arduino as shown in [ricardouvina's instructable](https://www.instructables.com/id/Simple-IR-proximity-sensor-with-Arduino/). The sensor requires IR LEDs, an IR diode receiver, and resistors. Working through this instructable is a great way to learn how an active sensor works and the output signal that is generated. The nice part about this approach is that the output is an analog signal that corresponds to the amount of IR radiation detected by the sensor, which usually represents the distance an object is from the sensor. Therefore, you can use this information to make an electronic device behave differently depending on how close the object is to the sensor. Ricardouvina's instructable demonstrates this with a buzzer.

The downside to building your own IR sensor is that it takes a lot of time. Instead you can buy a completely constructed IR sensor with either an analog or digital output. The analog IR sensors are generally more expensive, but they give you distance information. The digital IR sensors are cheaper, but they only tell you whether or not the sensor is blocked. A trimpot on the sensor is used to adjust the sensitivity of the digital IR sensors. There are even more sophisticated IR sensors that encode distance, as well as the velocity and direction of certain gestures.

How well do IR sensors work for projects requiring a lot of sensors? If you just want to track objects over a large area with lots of sensors, then the best IR sensor to use is probably a digital active IR sensor. Analog IR sensors, especially gesture sensors, are more complicated, more expensive, and require more time to process information than the digital active IR sensors. They may also be noisier than you think, and to get a precise measurement with them you will probably need to average measurements, which takes time and will slow down your device if you are using a lot of sensors.

Pros: Digital active IR sensors are cheap. Detection without touching the sensor. Analog IR sensors provide object distance information.

Cons: Will take time to build a lot by hand. Analog IR sensors are more expensive. A lot of IR sensors will be difficult to calibration. Noisier signal. Can be cross talk from IR radiation emitted by other sensors or surrounding IR radiation.
