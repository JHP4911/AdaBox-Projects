While most of us tend to put it off until the final step, tidying up your [electronics projects](https://www.hackster.io/projects?ref=topnav) into a presentable form tends to be hardest part of the whole process. You've got to figure out where to put everything, how to run your rat's nest of wires, and somehow make it look nice enough to post pictures online. There has just got to be a better way!

Well, the folks over at [STEGO BOARD](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1720680804/stego-board) think there is, and they just might have it. The concept behind the STEGO BOARD is as simple as it gets: give makers a simple metal plate that has all the holes necessary to mount just about anything. Each plate, which comes in two sizes, has holes spaced precisely to mount everything from [Raspberry Pis](https://www.hackster.io/raspberry-pi), to LCDs, to actual Mini ITX motherboards.

Even better, the STEGO BOARD itself can be easily mounted on a wall or the back of a TV. You can even stack multiple boards on top of each other with the included spacers for complex projects. Various [3D printed](https://www.hackster.io/3d-printing) racks, mounts, and covers are available, and more are sure to be designed soon once makers get some STEGO BOARDS in their hands.

While it is [currently on Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1720680804/stego-board), it has already been completely funded. Potential backers shouldn't have much to worry about when it comes to fulfillment, as the STEGO BOARD appears to be a simple product to manufacture. Early bird orders are expected to begin shipping at the end of November.
